<a href="http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project EPIC</a> - Prof. Ken Anderson leads the Big Data research for Project EPIC. He and his students designed and implemented a large-scale data collection and analytics infrastructure for Twitter. It is capable of collecting ~8M tweets per day during major crisis events. The research team has been working hard on developing software to filter, sample, and process that data.

<a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/research.htm">Complex Network</a> - Prof. Aaron Clauset leads a team of students to study complex network systems, in part for its ability to provide a rigorous foundation to the study of biological and social complexity. They focus on developing novel methods and models of large-scale structure (things like modules, communities and hierarchies) that can be fitted directly to empirical network data and which make precise predictions about missing information or future evolution.
